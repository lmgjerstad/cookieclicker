CookieAuto is an automation tool for [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker).

It features several mechanic options including those for auto-buying upgrades and buildings (Cursors, Grandmas, etc.). To use these features, CookieAuto comes with a simplistic UI built into what already exists.

## Installation

Before you install CookieAuto, you'll need to install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net).

To install CookieAuto, follow the next few steps:

1. Click on the extension, which gives a dropdown menu. Click &quot;Dashboard&quot;.
2. When the new page opens, click on &quot;Utilities&quot; in the tabbed menu.
3. At the bottom of the page, you will find a section called &quot;Install from URL&quot;
 - Copy and paste the following link into it, and press &quot;Install&quot;
 - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmgjerstad/cookieclicker/master/auto.js`
4. Once the next page loads, you can press the &quot;Install&quot; button to add it.

## Usage

Once installed, Tampermonkey will be given the instruction to automatically load it when you open your game in your browser, and you&apos;re set! Just like you did before, but now you can watch your computer do the work for you.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome. Just fork the repository at [@lmgjerstad/cookieclicker](https://github.com/lmgjerstad/cookieclicker), and make your own edits. Then, you can add a pull request to merge your repository&apos;s branch with ours.

To file a bug report, open the Tampermonkey dashboard, and, under CookieAuto, click the &quot;bug&quot; button on the right. You can also just head to the [Issues](https://github.com/lmgjerstad/cookieclicker/issues) page on GitHub, and click &quot;New issue.&quot;

We generally follow the [Google JavaScript Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) for code that gets submitted.

## Wiki

The wiki on GitHub is not currently available, but will eventually be available at https://github.com/lmgjerstad/cookieclicker/wiki. Here, you will find exactly what each control does and how to use it, along with a few other things.

### Developer Notes

- As of right now, CookieAuto is **NOT** cross-compatible with other add-ons. Don't worry, we are working on this.
- Nothing in beta versions of the program can be guaranteed stable.
